*1.6*

* Created a separate console version of the application. Can be useful as part of a script or to run as a windows task or linux cronjob or something like that.
* Deleted directories will be written to a log-file (and printed to the console in case of the console version).
* It now ignores directories that are marked as hidden, system, et cetera. Can be overridden with a switch.
* Added support for some switches:
** -q: Run, clean and quit without requiring any user intervention. The directory to clean must be supplied as a command-line argument for this to do any good.
** -s: No output. No console printing, no logging, no nothing. (For the gui version, the gui will still be visible of course, but no logging will be done).
** -a: Clean all directories including hidden directories, system directories and so on.
** -v: Be verbose by also outputting all the directories that were _not_ deleted and why.
** -h: Output help about the switches.

*1.5*

* You can now drag and drop a folder onto the executable and it will open up with that folder as initial path. Isn't that just fantastic, or what??

*1.4*

* Shuffled the user interface a bit.
* Added a confirmation dialog.
* Added an icon to the executable.
* Changed how the icons are loaded in the user interface. (Hopefully fixes: [workitem:4495])

* Otherwise some various refactoring has of course occurred in the code base.

*1.3*

* No longer crashing when trying to read a folder with no access.
* Changed the icons and made the application icon show up in the task bar.
* The cleaning process can now be cancelled.
* When finished, it will report how many folders were scanned and deleted.

* Code base has been refactored quite a bit.
* TFS bindings have been broken (I've started using subversion instead).
